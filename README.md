# Captain-Hook

Hooks for hooking up the hooks

Based on [Mattonrails](http://www.mattonrails.com)'s [Captain Hook](https://github.com/mattonrails/captain-hook)

Adapted for Heroku and multiple downstream hooks by [Stringbot](http://stringbot.com)

## TODO

* All hooks are currently hard-coded in `lib/hooks.rb`, so it's not very adaptable without forking
* Make it easier to run multiple apps through the same instance
